<p>As far as bundlers go I've always loved Browserify. It's simple, does the job, and I'd probably know nothing about streams without it. Can you ever really know streams? I briefly tried Webpack, but found it to be a configuration nightmare and the community is kind of aggressive. And I've had my eye on Parcel. It looks very nice, but I find it strange that it comes with so much, including built in support for Sass and Vue for instance. I'd love it if I could make a lighter Parcel</p>

<p>For a while I've wrapped all my Browserify and Postcss usage up into a cli published as @erickmerchant/assets. And I was starting to address incremental builds but don't really want to add Chokidar via Watchify. And looking at my code that handles js and css I'd really like them to be basically the same. Then I had a very stupid idea. Take module-deps which browserify uses, pair it with detective (which module-deps uses already by default) for js and postcss-detective for css, and write my own very lite bundler that can handle js and css, maybe have plugins for other types, and have watching and incremental builds built in that essentially work very similarily. module-deps can pair with browser-pack already, so most of the work would be concating css I think. I did say this is a stupid idea. It's reinventing wheels. I'll probably learn a ton doing it though so why not.</p>

<p>I'm basically going to compare this new bundler to Parcel. One thing I know I need to do better than Parcel is css. It currently won't work well with css custom properties or custom media queries. And I actually think that's ok for watching/developing. For building/production though those things need to work. IE compile down for older browsers. Also, at some point I'll probably care about hot module reloading but I don't now.</p>
