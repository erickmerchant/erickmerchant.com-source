title: 'Help Protect Your Domain From Being Spoofed'
summary: 'If you don''t send email from domain you probably should let everyone know with a SPF record.'

This is a sort of follow up to [DNSimple URL Records](/posts/dnsimple-url-records/), and a continuation of my exploration of DNS.

If you have a domain, but don't use it to send email, you can help prevent anyone from sending email using your domain with a SPF record. This is something I think most people who have blogs should do. Be they static or traditional.

With DNSimple you would go to the page for your domain and then go to the advanced editor. The url looks like _https://dnsimple.com/domains/example.com/records_. Replace example.com with your domain. From there click Add Record. Select SPF. On the form that you're taken to leave everything blank except the All Others field, a select. Select Hard Fail. When you're done you'll see 2 new records in the table at _https://dnsimple.com/domains/example.com/records_, a TXT and a SPF. They should both read "v=spf1 -all". Repeat this process for your www domain if you have one, or any other subdomain, but put www or another subdomain in the Name field.

Other domain management services may not separate SPF from TXT since SPF is just a TXT record.
