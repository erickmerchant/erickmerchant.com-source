title: The Importance of Compression
summary: About how my host doesn't support Gzip.
---
It would appear that my host no longer supports Gzip. Doing some research seems to reveal that it is no longer configurable, and only turned on sometimes for certain file types. This has a terrible impact on the performance of my site.

As you can see below with Gzip enabled, served off my local dev server, my site ([this page specifically](/posts/a-newer-site/)) is nearly 60KB transferred. ![With Gzip](/uploads/thumbnails/with-gzip.jpg) Without it is more than 3 times that. ![Without Gzip](/uploads/thumbnails/without-gzip.jpg) What is significant here is the size/content column. With Gzip, the 3 resources that are being served from my domain, the size of the data being sent is smaller than the actual resource. This is because it is compressed. Without Gzip the data sent is more or equal to the actual size of the resource.

I'm currently looking at [Pagoda Box][pagoda_box] and [Fortrabbit][fortrabbit] as possible alternatives. I think this might be the final nail in the coffin for me for shared hosting. First it was the lack of APC or any other accelerator&mdash;which was one of the reasons I wrote a static site generator&mdash;and now this.
