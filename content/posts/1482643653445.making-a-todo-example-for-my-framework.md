This year I started working on a framework that I published as [@erickmerchant/framework](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@erickmerchant/framework) to npm. It's not meant to be a serious contender in the world of frameworks. By which I mean I'm not going to advocate that others use it, and if I ever do I'll give it a less generic name and publish it as an unscoped package. But I intend to use it and keep improving it. It's inspired by React and others, but without JSX and much simpler. I first saw the term "data down, actions up" with yo-yo and I'd describe it as such. It doesn't come with a built-in way of outputting html, but I've been using it with [yo-yo](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yo-yo) and [diffhtml](https://www.npmjs.com/package/diffhtml). This month I've been working a lot on making a Todo example, as in TodoMVC. Below is the javascript for that with a lot of comments.

``` javascript
/* We'll need the framework. */
const framework = require('@erickmerchant/framework')
/* Ift is used to make conditionals more readable. It's something else I wrote recently. */
const ift = require('@erickmerchant/ift')('')
/* Yo-yo is used to output our html and update our target. Our component will return html using yo-yo's tagged template strings. */
const html = require('bel')
/* Will be used to update the target with the results from calling component. */
const diff = require('nanomorph')
/* We need a dom element, a place where the application will be rendered. */
const target = document.querySelector('main')
/* A global setting used by the store, a key for localStorage. */
const storageKey = 'todo-data'
const enterKey = 13
const escapeKey = 27
const store = [mainStore, storageStore]

/* Here we start the application, passing in the target (seen above), the stores and component (both seen below), and diff (above). */
framework({target, store, component, diff})(function ({dispatch}) {
  /* Calling framework returns a function to do some initial dispatch calls or set up global event handlers that will need dispatch. In this case we set up a very minimal hash router. The target is also provided to this function but we don't use it here. */
  window.onhashchange = function () {
    /* When the hash changes we do a dispatch. The arguments passed to dispatch are free form. You decide what they should be. The store just needs to be able to understand them. */
    dispatch('set-hash', {hash: window.location.hash})
  }

  /* We immediately dispatch the current hash. */
  dispatch('set-hash', {hash: window.location.hash})
})

function storageStore (state = {}) {
  if (state.todos == null) {
    /* If state.todos is null (first call to store) we'll check to see if there is something in localStorage using the key defined above. */
    const stored = window.localStorage.getItem(storageKey)
    let data = {}

    if (stored) {
      try {
        data = JSON.parse(stored)
      } catch (e) {
        console.error(e)
      }
    }

    state.completed = data.todos != null ? data.todos.filter(([id, todo]) => todo.completed).length : 0

    /* The todos and next should both be defined. */
    state.todos = new Map(data.todos || [])
    state.next = data.next || 0
  }

  /* Save state.todos and state.next to localStorage. */
  window.localStorage.setItem(storageKey, JSON.stringify({todos: [...state.todos], next: state.next}))

  return state
}

/* The store is the source of truth for the state of our application. Every time dispatch is called the store is called with the previous state (previously returned from calling the store) and any arguments passed to dispatch. It returns a new state. At the top of this store we set up a default state as a default parameter. We'll use a plain object for our state, but it could be anything (the framework doesn't dictate it being a plain object). The properties of this object are...

  - todos: This will be our items. A Map, but null by default.
  - completed: The count of how many completed todos there are.
  - current: If we're editing an item, this is its id.
  - next: A number, incremented on every new item and used as the key for our item.
  - hash: Should correspond to the current window.location.hash or '#/all' by default.

The other two parameters are action which will be a string, and args which will be an object. The store can accept any arguments after the first that it wants. The dispatches that your app does just need to know what to send. */
function mainStore (state = {todos: null, completed: 0, current: null, next: 0, hash: '#/all'}, action, args) {
  /* Below are all our actions. Each one changes the state in some way. */
  switch (action) {
    /* Set state.current to an id (the key) of one of the todos. */
    case 'set-current':
      state.current = args.id
      break

    /* Set state.hash. Used by our hash router. */
    case 'set-hash':
      state.hash = typeof args.hash === 'string' && args.hash !== '' ? args.hash : '#/all'
      break

    /* Unset state.current. Setting it back to its default of null. */
    case 'unset-current':
      state.current = null
      break

    /* Add a new todo. */
    case 'add-todo':
      state.todos.set(state.next++, {
        title: args.title,
        completed: false
      })
      break

    /* Change the title of an existing todo. */
    case 'edit-todo':
      if (state.todos.has(args.id)) {
        const todo = state.todos.get(args.id)

        todo.title = args.title
      }
      break

    /* Set the completed prop of all todos. */
    case 'set-all-todos-completedness':
      state.todos.forEach((todo) => {
        todo.completed = args.completed
      })

        state.completed = state.todos.size
      } else {
        state.completed = 0
      }
      break

    case 'set-todo-completedness':
      if (state.todos.has(args.id)) {
        const todo = state.todos.get(args.id)

        todo.completed = args.completed

        state.completed += (args.completed ? 1 : -1)
      }
      break

    /* Remove a todo. */
    case 'remove-todo':
      if (state.todos.has(args.id)) {
        if (state.todos.get(args.id).completed) {
          state.completed -= 1
        }

        state.todos.delete(args.id)
      }
      break

          state.todos.delete(id)
        }
      })

      state.completed = 0
      break
  }

  /* Finally return the state. It will be passed to the component now and our app will change. */
  return state
}

/* The component is the html of our app. It's also all the event handlers. It gets called with the current state, a dispatch function to indirectly signal that state needs to change, and next which accepts a callback to be called on nextTick. */
function component ({state, dispatch, next}) {
  /* Next can be used to do things after our component renders or is diffed, like scroll to a specific element or focus an input. Here we want to grab a todo that's being edited if there is one, focus it, and place the cursor at the end. */
