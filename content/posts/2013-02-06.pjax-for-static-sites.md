title: Pjax for Static Sites
summary: Having a static site doesn't mean you have to give up on all dynamic features.
---
While writing a static site generator there was one dynamic feature I wasn't willing to part with. My site uses [Pjax][pjax] to progressively enhance links, making everything faster by only requesting and replacing the main content, the `[role="main"]` element, of the page when a link is clicked. Pjax is great because not only does it use ajax, it uses the History API to change the URL without a page refresh. This is great! The page doesn't need to be rendered again, CSS and JS aren't needlessly requested again, and everyone wins.

To keep this dynamic feature I create 2 files for every page, an index.html and a pjax.html. Then I have the following rule in my htaccess file.

```
#apache conf or .htaccess code
RewriteCond %{HTTP:X-PJAX} true
RewriteRule ^(.*)/$ $1/pjax.html [L]
RewriteCond %{HTTP:X-PJAX} true
RewriteRule ^$ pjax.html [L]
```
