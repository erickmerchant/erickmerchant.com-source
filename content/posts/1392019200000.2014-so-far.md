title: '2014, So Far'
summary: 'The first two months of 2014.'
---
I haven't written anything in a long time. To break this dry spell I've decided to write a summary of 2014 with a bit of looking ahead. So far 2014 has been a year of learning new things, improving my website in very significant though unseen ways, and pushing ahead to version 1.0.0 of Wright.

I've started playing around with [gulp]. I never used grunt so I can't really speak to the differences between it and gulp. One thing is certain though. Where as I never started using grunt even though it seemed very useful, I was using gulp within 12 hours of seeing a snippet of it. It also got me writing [Node] for the first time. Tools that get people writing code are good.

I've moved registration and DNS for my domain to a service separate from my webhost. Something I've wanted to do for years. [DNSimple] is really easy to use and has great prices. At the same time my website is now on [GitHub Pages][github_pages]. So far I have no complaints. It's fast, free, I deploy with pushes rather than dragging files, and Gzip is always on. The only thing, not really a complaint, is that css and js files are not set to use far future expires headers so cache-busting is useless. I see lots of 304 headers though and the response time is under 300ms usually so I'm happy.
