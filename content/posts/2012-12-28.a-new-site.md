title: 'A New Site'
summary: 'The launching of a new site.'
---
This is my new site. I'll be writing a lot about how I made it in later posts, but for now here is some of the history of erickmerchant.com.

For years I had a site that had a nice design. It was a demonstration of my talents. Something that I could send to potential employers in lieu of any sites I had developed. But it never really had much content. The whole time I felt like I should be writing. Primarily because it would give having a website a purpose, but also to chronicle what I was learning in my career and at my job.

So I installed [Wordpress][wordpress]. But the Wordpress site sat there for a long time, because it was, well Wordpress, and I'm not really a fan of it. You can't really be inspired to write if you don't like the software you're using.

A long time passed while I developed a CMS, which later turned into a MVC framework that ran a CMS. It was a learning experience, but ultimately I abandoned all that work when I discovered [FuelPHP][fuelphp]. Suddenly it seemed plausible to replace Wordpress with something better in no time without having to invent all the parts myself. Fuel with [Bootstrap][bootstrap], and a little [jQuery][jquery] and a new site was born.

Now to write.
