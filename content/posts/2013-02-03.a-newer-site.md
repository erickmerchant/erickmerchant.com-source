title: A Newer Site
summary: About how I didn't want to pay for SSL so I decided to make a static site generator.
---
About a month ago I wrote about my [new website](/posts/a-new-site/) and promised to write articles about how I had made a blogging system with [FuelPHP][fuelphp]. Those articles never happened. To use the system I had created, I needed to buy an SSL cert, or at least a dedicated IP and create a self-signed cert. While I technically could have done either of those things, I also wasn't happy with the performance of PHP on my shared hosting. No opcode caching. And I started to realize that I didn't want to login to edit my site using a textarea or WYSIWYG. Interfaces like that are what I make for clients, but I write code. I wanted to deal with files and code, not forms.

So I decided to create a static site generator. I could have went with a system that was already written like [Octopress][octopress] or [PieCrust][piecrust], but a static site generator was an interesting problem. Writing my own also seemed just as simple as learning one of the ones that already existed.

I'm calling it Wright. That's not set in stone yet though. Soon I plan on putting it up on GitHub along with suitable docs and tests, but there is still a lot to do. It uses [Composer][composer] for dependency management. The packages it uses are [Twig][twig] for templating, Symfony's [Console][console], [Yaml][yaml], and [Filesystem][filesystem], dflydev's [Markdown][markdown], Kris Wallsmith's [Assetic][assetic] for assets, and then [Imagine][imagine] for manipulating images.

It was cool to finally use Composer for something non-trivial. And Twig templates are great. I can't imagine going back to using straight PHP for templates.
