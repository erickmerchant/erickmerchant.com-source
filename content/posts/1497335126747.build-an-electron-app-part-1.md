This post assumes you know what [Electron](https://electron.atom.io/) is.

> If you can build a website, you can build a desktop app. Electron is a framework for creating native applications with web technologies like JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It takes care of the hard parts so you can focus on the core of your application.

> â€” The Electron Website

I've never built a full Electron application that actually does something, so my first step is to decide what I want to make. It should be useful. Something I really need at the moment is something that can track time. We use a well known task management website at work, and there is time tracking there, but I want something I can use anywhere, especially at home. I should be able to tell it what I'm doing and it should start tracking time, pausing anything currently being tracked. Then at any time I should be able to get a sum of the time tracked for any of the things I've tracked. I'm picturing an input with two roles: enter a task, and search through previously entered ones. All interaction can be through keyboard input, except maybe clicking into the input. We can write to maybe a sqlite db. [Seems possible](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32504307/how-to-use-sqlite3-module-with-electron). Also an export import feature could be useful in cases of having to move systems maybe. Let's keep it simple at first though. The only configuration I could see useful is how time is formatted, but again let's keep it simple. Being able to point to an existing db would be useful as well. This feature would compete with import/export in a way.

I'm going to start with a [boilerplate](https://github.com/sindresorhus/electron-boilerplate), from this [Awesome list](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome-electron). I'm going to use some of my other projects to build the frontend. Mainly we'll use [@erickmerchant/assets](https://github.com/erickmerchant/assets) and [@erickmerchant/framework](https://github.com/erickmerchant/framework). I think of the render process as the frontend in Electron app. I could be slightly wrong about that, but I'll find out.

For the db side I think [Sequelize](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sequelize) is the thing to use. I imagine two tables. Tasks which has a title. And then Sessions, which has a many to one relationship with Tasks, so a task_id, a start timestamp and an end timestamp. We can add an end timestamp to any sessions that don't have one (meaning they're currently running) when the app quits, or they're ended normally, or in the event of a crash when the app is opened. That should result in the most accurate time tracking possible.

I was thinking of firing up a server and using something like [get-port](https://www.npmjs.com/package/get-port) to pick a port to listen at, but the built in IPC should be a better way to communicate between render and main processes. [Example](http://electron.rocks/different-ways-to-communicate-between-main-and-renderer-process/).

That's it for now. I've created a repo called [time-tracking-app](https://github.com/erickmerchant/time-tracking-app) and have done an initial commit.
