title: 'Working on a Composer Package Locally'
summary: 'Some composer.json tricks'
---
Say you have a package, and you want to develop it locally, use it in another project that you're also developing locally, and only commit changes to GitHub when you want to. This is the situation I find myself in. I'm working on erickmerchant/wright, my static site generator, but I'm also working on erickmerchant/wright-skeleton, an example site using Wright. I want to make modifications to erickmerchant/wright without committing them immediately to GitHub, but still use them in my local version of wright-skeleton.

The composer.json for wright-skeleton looks like this.

```javascript
{
    "name": "erickmerchant/wright-skeleton",
    "description": "a starting point for building a site using erickmerchant/wright",
    "license": "MIT",
    "authors": [
        {
            "name": "Erick Merchant",
            "email": "erickmerchant@gmail.com"
        }
    ],
    "minimum-stability": "dev",
    "prefer-stable": true,
    "require": {
        "erickmerchant/wright": "*"
    }
}
```

To work on Wright locally I just have to change it to.

```javascript
{
    "name": "erickmerchant/wright-skeleton",
    "description": "a starting point for building a site using erickmerchant/wright",
    "license": "MIT",
    "authors": [
        {
            "name": "Erick Merchant",
            "email": "erickmerchant@gmail.com"
        }
    ],
    "minimum-stability": "dev",
    "prefer-stable": true,
    "repositories": [
        {
            "type": "vcs",
            "url": "file:///Users/erickmerchant/Code/wright/"
        }
    ],
    "require": {
        "erickmerchant/wright": "master"
    }
}
```

There are probably other ways to do this but this way works well for me.
