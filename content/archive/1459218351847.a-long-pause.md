title: "A Long Pause..."
summary: "I must keep building on the past."
---
It's been about one and half years since I last wrote anything. Looking back at what I've written before my first instinct is to cringe and archive it all, start over, but I won't do that. I must keep building on the past.

What I do want to do though is start writing regularly. Once a week. Anything. Something once a week. I also want to limit meta, reflective posts like this to close to never. It seems like that's mostly what I was writing before. Also there should be at least one or two things that I write about. Like topics or themes. Currently my main interests are Node, Browserify, PostCSS, and Virtual Dom stuff, but to avoid always writing about how I build this site I will take those interests and make something once a week with them and write about how I built it. I really need images for each blog post too, but at the very least I should have code examples. If there is no code or pictures there is no post.
