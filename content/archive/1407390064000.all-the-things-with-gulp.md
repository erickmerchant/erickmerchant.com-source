title: "All the Things with Gulp"
summary: "gulp is awesome. I write about some unconventional things I did with it."

[This](http://gulpjs.com/) is gulp.js the streaming build system. You write tasks and then run them from the terminal. If you run `gulp` it will run the 'default' task that you have defined in your gulpfile.js file in the current working directory. Or you can specify the tasks to run like `gulp sass js`. There are a lot of gulp plugins you can use for things like compiling sass, combining and minifying js, and many other things. I now use gulp to compile this entire site. I use it to not only compile sass, combine and minify js, but I also have it take markdown files, match them up to templates, and generate html. Then I have a watch task that watches the filesystem and reruns the right tasks when things change. And then there is a serve task where I can browse my site before committing it to github. No need for Apache or nginx. To make a new post I run `gulp make --in content/drafts/ --title "The Name of My Post"` and then to move that to the folder where it will be published I do `gulp move --file content/drafts/the-name-of-my-post.md --to content/posts/ --date`. I've put the whole thing [here](https://github.com/erickmerchant/erickmerchant.com-source).
