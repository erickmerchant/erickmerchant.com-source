<p>This year I started working on a framework that I published as <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@erickmerchant/framework">@erickmerchant/framework</a> to npm. It's not meant to be a serious contender in the world of frameworks, but I intend to use it and keep improving it. It's inspired by React and others, but much simpler. I first saw the term "data down, actions up" with yo-yo and I'd describe it as such. It doesn't come with a built-in way of outputting html, but I've been using it with <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/nanohtml">nanohtml</a> and <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/nanomorph">nanomorph</a>. This month I've been working a lot on making a Todo example, as in TodoMVC. Below are the three JavaScript files for that with a lot of comments.

<h2>index.js</h2>

<pre>
  <code src="./code/todo-index.js" class="language-javascript"></code>
</pre>

<h2>store.js</h2>

<pre>
  <code src="./code/todo-store.js" class="language-javascript"></code>
</pre>

<h2>component.js</h2>

<pre>
  <code src="./code/todo-component.js" class="language-javascript"></code>
</pre>
