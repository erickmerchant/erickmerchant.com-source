## To Do

- Remove font reference from content/defaults.yml. Make it a @import and then write a task to remove the @import and replace it with a link in the html using cheerio.
- Have the the geomicons task in tasks/icons.js traverse the html and find what icons are actually used.
- Have the js task in tasks/js.js traverse the html and find what Prism languages are actually used.
